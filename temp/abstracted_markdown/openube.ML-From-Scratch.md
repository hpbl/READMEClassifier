# Machine Learning From Scratch

Python implementations of various Machine Learning models and algorithms from scratch.

While some of the matrix operations that are implemented by hand (such as calculation of covariance matrix) are available in numpy I have decided to add these as well to make sure that I understand how the linear algebra is applied.

The purpose of this project is purely self-educational.
