The exercise framework is @abstr_hyperlink .

## Exercise Framework

Khan Academy has created a generic framework for building exercises. This framework, together with the exercises themselves, can be used completely independently of the Khan Academy application.

The framework exists in two components:

  * An HTML markup for specifying exercises.
  * A jQuery plugin for generating a usable, interactive, exercise from the HTML markup.



## Writing Exercises

The process for writing exercises is rather well documented. More information about this process can be found in the @abstr_hyperlink . Specifically:
