# Discord Official API Documentation

This repo contains the official Discord API documentation, which can be viewed online @abstr_hyperlink . Before submitting pull-requests, please remember to _fully_ read the Contributing guidelines.

## Markdown Syntax

This repository uses special markdown syntax that helps style the resulting web version of the documentation.

### H @abstr_number Headings

H @abstr_number headings should be used above tables and code blocks to properly label them.

### Linking

Links between docs can be achieved by using a hash symbol (#), plus the markdown file name, plus another hash, and finally the dash-separated anchor. For instance, to link to the above H @abstr_number heading section:

@abstr_code_section 

### Alert Boxes

Alert boxes are achieved by using a block quote that has one of 'warning', 'danger' or 'info' on the first line.

## Join the Unofficial Discord API Server

The Unofficial Discord API server is a common hangout for library and bot developers alike. It's a great starting point for those looking to dive in and learn bot-creation with the Discord API.
