## Usage

For all usage and documentation please see: @abstr_hyperlink 

## Version

@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number - stable and versioned using @abstr_hyperlink .

**NOTE:** @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number introduces a new theme which is not backwards compatible in the sense it won't _look_ like the old version. However, the actual API has not changed at all. You might want to run @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number in a branch to make sure you are ok with the theme design changes.

## Contributing

To contribute to the framework please make sure to checkout your branch based on `jb-development`!! This is very important as it allows me to accept your pull request without having to publish a public version release.

Small, atomic Features, bugs, etc. Use the `jb-development` branch but note it will likely change fast as pull requests are accepted. Please rebase as often as possible when working. Work on small, atomic features/bugs to avoid upstream commits affecting/breaking your development work.

For Big Features or major API extensions/edits: This is the one case where I'll accept pull-requests based off the master branch. This allows you to work in isolation but it means I'll have to manually merge your work into the next public release. Translation : it might take a bit longer so please be patient! (but sincerely thank you).
