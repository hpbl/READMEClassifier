# What the plugin does for you

jmsPaymentPlugin is designed to provide a generic persistence layer for processing payments. 

  * It is not coupled to any specific payment provider, or process flow.
  * It does not make assumptions about your domain model.
  * It has a flexible event system that allows you to hook into the payment process without altering payment classes.
  * It is easy to add new payment methods (support for PayPal, and Micropayment already built-in)
  * It is robust, and stable due to many unit tests.
