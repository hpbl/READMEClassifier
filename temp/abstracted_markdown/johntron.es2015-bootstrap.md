# ES @abstr_number base project

This project uses Babel to transpile both back-end and front-end JavaScript on-the-fly, and SystemJS to load transpiled modules in the browser. See @abstr_hyperlink or @abstr_hyperlink .

## Usage

Change presets and other @abstr_hyperlink by updating the "babel" section of package.json

## How it works

@abstr_number . HyperDev runs the `start` command which passes `server.js` through Babel (obeying options in package.json) and then runs the resulting JavaScript. @abstr_number . The `server.js` defines an Express server and middleware function which passes all requests ending in ".js" through Babel's `transformFile`. @abstr_number . User requests the index in their browser. @abstr_number . Back-end serves index.html. @abstr_number . Browser loads SystemJS. @abstr_number . Browser requests app.js. @abstr_number . Back-end transpiles app.js using same options from step @abstr_number , but with SystemJS module definitions. @abstr_number . Browser evaluates ES @abstr_number code generated by previous step.
