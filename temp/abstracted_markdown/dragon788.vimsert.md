# Vimsert

### Overview

Vimsert is a simple, open-source Chrome extension for editing inputs on the web. It puts the power of Vim and the @abstr_hyperlink together in the browser. Better yet, it uses the awesome @abstr_hyperlink dark theme.

A few contrib ideas: \- Make Vimsert play more nicely with Vimium \- See license below \- Issues \- No reason this couldn't also work in Firefox

### License

_Help wanted_ I'm not a lawyer, feel free to submit a PR adding a license with an ELI @abstr_number . I'd really only like attribution and I'm not sure which to choose.

### Credit

Vimsert utilizes the following open source projects: \- Ace editor \- Solarized \- jQuery
