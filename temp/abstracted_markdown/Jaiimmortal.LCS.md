# LCS

The @abstr_hyperlink is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The longest common subsequence problem is a classic computer science problem, and has applications in @abstr_hyperlink .

Use Python @abstr_number . @abstr_number (while entering the string, enter them in quotes :P)

This algorithm, printing the Longest Common Subsequence problem falls under Dynammic programming and has been implemented two compare two DNA strands and get the lenghthiest subsequence of all the genereated subsequences and print it's length. It also focuses on avoiding the overlapping i.e., avoid calculating the subsequence that has already been generated.

Random DNA sequences can be generated @abstr_hyperlink

The above is a screenshot of py @abstr_number version of the code.

For python @abstr_number version , execute the try.py

For python @abstr_number version , execute the main.py
