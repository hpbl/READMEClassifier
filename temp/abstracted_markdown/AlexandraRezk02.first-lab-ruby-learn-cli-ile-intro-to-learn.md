# Solving your first Lab

## Objectives

@abstr_number . Open a lab by clicking "Open" on this page on Learn.co @abstr_number . Run the lab's tests with the `learn` CLI command @abstr_number . Make a change to your copy of this lab @abstr_number . Pass the tests using the `learn` CLI command @abstr_number . Submit the passing lab with the `learn submit` CLI command

After you click on this, your Learn IDE will launch. 

@abstr_number . You should see all of the files associated with this lab in the Learn IDE's file browser on the left pane.

@abstr_number . In the console on the bottom pane, run the test suite by typing `learn` and hitting enter. You'll see something similar to:

@abstr_image 

You can see your test is currently failing, which is fine. We haven't done any work yet, so it makes sense.

The failure reads: `Make sure you have added a new file or edited edit-me.txt`

@abstr_number . To pass this lab, make any change to the content of the `edit-me.txt` file. You can do this by clicking on the name of the file in the file browser in the left pane; its contents will load in the text editor. Type into the text editor to change the contents of the file, then save your changes.

@abstr_number . Once your local tests are passing, you can submit this lab by running `learn submit` from your terminal.
