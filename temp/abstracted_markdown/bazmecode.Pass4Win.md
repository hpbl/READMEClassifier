# Pass @abstr_number Win

@abstr_hyperlink 

Windows version of Pass (http://www.passwordstore.org/) in the sense that the store (password structure) is and should be exactly the same between the two programs.

If you want Pass @abstr_number Win in your language, that's now quite possible with the help of Crowdin (http://crowdin.com/). Drop me an e-mail and I'll invite you as translator. The available languages are listed at https://github.com/mbos/Pass @abstr_number Win/wiki/Translation

I really liked the idea of a password store I could access on my shell, and even Android devices. But my main PC is a Windows machine. So I needed a Windows implementation.....

Make sure you have GnuPG for windows installed (http://www.gpg @abstr_number win.org/) and have at least one secret key. The setup can be downloaded from https://github.com/mbos/Pass @abstr_number Win/releases

I'm using GpgAPI (https://gpgapi.codeplex.com/) for interfacing with GnuPG. And LibGit @abstr_number Sharp (https://github.com/libgit @abstr_number /libgit @abstr_number sharp) for git integration.
