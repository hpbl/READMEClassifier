## What is Cookie Consent?

@abstr_hyperlink is a lightweight JavaScript plugin for alerting users about the use of cookies on your website.

It is designed to help you comply with the hideous EU Cookie Law and not make you want to kill yourself in the process. So we made it fast, free, and relatively painless.

## Version @abstr_number . @abstr_number

Version @abstr_number . @abstr_number is a complete rewrite from version @abstr_number . The most substantial new features are:

  * the ability to GeoLocate and only show the addon to people in the relevant countries
  * callback hooks for showing/accepting/revoking the banner
  * support for different types of compliance, giving you the flexibility to obey even the strictest cookie laws
  * easy no-fuss themes and customisable styles

The easiest way to get up and running is to use our @abstr_hyperlink .
