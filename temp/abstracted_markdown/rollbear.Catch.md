## What's the Catch?

Catch stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in Headers and is a multi-paradigm automated test framework for C++ and Objective-C (and, maybe, C). It is implemented entirely in a set of header files, but is packaged up as a single header for extra convenience.

## How to use it

This documentation comprises these three parts:

  * Why do we need yet another C++ Test Framework?
  * Tutorial - getting started
  * Reference section - all the details



The documentation will continue until morale improves
