# Homebrew-Cask

#### Important December update: Homebrew-Cask will now be kept up to date together with Homebrew (see @abstr_hyperlink for details). If you haven’t yet, run `brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update` to switch to the new system.

## #### Important: At some point in the future Homebrew-cask will change its behaviour from linking apps to moving them. See @abstr_hyperlink for details.

_“To install, drag this icon…” no more!_

Homebrew-Cask extends @abstr_hyperlink and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI Mac applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

We do this by providing a friendly homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries.

It’s implemented as a `homebrew` @abstr_hyperlink called `cask`.

## Let’s try it!

To start using Homebrew-Cask, you just need @abstr_hyperlink installed.

And there we have it. Google Chrome installed with a few quick commands: no clicking, no dragging, no dropping.

## Reporting Bugs

We still have bugs — and we are busy fixing them! If you have a problem, don’t be shy about @abstr_hyperlink on our @abstr_hyperlink . Always search for your issue before posting a new one.

When reporting bugs, remember that homebrew-cask is an independent project from Homebrew. Do your best to direct bug reports to the appropriate project. If your command-line started with `brew cask`, bring the bug to us first!

Before reporting a bug, make sure you have the latest versions of homebrew, homebrew-cask, and all Taps by running the following command:

@abstr_code_section 

In addition, if you haven’t yet, run `brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update` once to @abstr_hyperlink .

If the issue persists, please run the problematic command with the `--verbose` flag and post its and `brew cask doctor`’s outputs in distinct @abstr_hyperlink .
