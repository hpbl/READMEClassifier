# Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ( @abstr_hyperlink )

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

  * You don't need to touch the command line
  * You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
  * You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
  * If you're on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier
  * It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it



In a few minutes you'll be set up with a minimal, responsive blog like the one below giving you more time to spend on writing epic blog posts!

## Quick Start

### Step @abstr_number ) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository

Fork this repo, then rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io.

Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at @abstr_hyperlink (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step @abstr_number )

### Step @abstr_number ) Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at @abstr_hyperlink - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon

> There are @abstr_number different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:
> 
> @abstr_number . Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below). @abstr_number . Use a third party GitHub content editor, like @abstr_hyperlink . It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy. @abstr_number . Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.

### Step @abstr_number ) Publish your first blog post

Edit `/_posts/ @abstr_number - @abstr_number - @abstr_number -Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This @abstr_hyperlink might come in handy.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the @abstr_hyperlink block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## Local Development

@abstr_number . Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc. @abstr_number . Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git` @abstr_number . Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve` @abstr_number . View your website at http:// @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number : @abstr_number / @abstr_number . Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

## Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by @abstr_hyperlink describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.

I want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that's useful to @abstr_number % of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it's not something that most people will use, it probably won't get merged. :guardsman:
