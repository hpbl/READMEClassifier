# Mining the Social Web ( @abstr_number nd Edition)

## Summary

_Mining the Social Web, @abstr_number nd Edition_ is available through O'Reilly Media, Amazon, and other fine book retailers. @abstr_hyperlink offers a number of great benefits, including a variety of digital formats and continual updates to the text of book for life! Better yet, if you choose to use O'Reilly's DropBox or Google Drive synchronization, your ebooks will automatically update every time there's an update. In other words, you'll always have the latest version of the book if you purchase the ebook through O'Reilly, which is why it's the recommended option in comparison to a paper copy or other electronic version. (If you prefer a @abstr_hyperlink , that's a fine option as well.)

There's an incredible turn-key virtual machine experience for this second edition of the book that provides you with a powerful social web mining toolbox. This toolbox provides the ability to explore and run all of the source code in a hassle-free manner. All that you have to do is @abstr_hyperlink to get the virtual machine installed, and you'll be running the example code in as little as @abstr_number - @abstr_number minutes. (And by the way, most of that time is waiting for files to download.)

This @abstr_hyperlink demonstrates the steps involved in installing the virtual machine, which installs every single dependency for you automatically and save you a lot of time. Even sophisticated power users tend to prefer using it versus using their own environments.

If you experience any problems at all with installation of the virtual machine, file an issue here on GitHub. Be sure to also follow @abstr_hyperlink on Twitter and like http://facebook.com/MiningTheSocialWeb on Facebook.

## Preview the Full-Text of Chapter @abstr_number (Mining Twitter)

Chapter @abstr_number of the book provides a gentle introduction to hacking on Twitter data. It's available in a variety of convenient formats

  * A free @abstr_hyperlink 
  * An @abstr_hyperlink excerpt
  * An @abstr_hyperlink (checked into this repository)



Choose one, or choose them all. There's no better way to get started than following along with the opening chapter.

## Preview the IPython Notebooks

This edition of _Mining the Social Web_ extensively uses @abstr_hyperlink to facilitate the learning and development process. If you're interested in what the example code for any particular chapter does, the best way to preview it is with the links below. When you're ready to develop, pull the source for this GitHub repository and follow the instructions for installing the virtual machine to get started.

## The _Mining the Social Web_ Virtual Machine

_You may enjoy @abstr_hyperlink that demonstrates the step-by-step instructions involved in installing the book's virtual machine._

The code for _Mining the Social Web_ is organized by chapter in an @abstr_hyperlink format to maximize enjoyment of following along with examples as part of an interactive experience. Unfortunately, some of the Python dependencies for the example code can be a little bit tricky to get installed and configured, so providing a completely turn-key virtual machine to make your reading experience as simple and enjoyable as possible is in order. Even if you are a seasoned developer, you may still find some value in using this virtual machine to get started and save yourself some time. The virtual machine is powered with @abstr_hyperlink , an amazing development tool that you'll probably want to know about and arguably makes working with virtualization even easier than a native @abstr_hyperlink or VMWare image. 

## Quick Start Guide

The recommended way of getting started with the example code is by taking advantage of the Vagrant-powered virtual machine as illusrated in @abstr_hyperlink . After all, you're more interested in following along and learning from the examples than installing and managing all of the system dependencies just to get to that point, right? 

@abstr_hyperlink provides clear step-by-step instructions for installing the virtual machine and is intended to serve as a quick start guide.

## The _Mining the Social Web_ Wiki

This project takes advantage of its GitHub repository's @abstr_hyperlink to act as a point of collaboration for consumers of the source code. Feel free to use the wiki however you'd like to share your experiences, and create additional pages as needed to curate additional information.

One of the more important wiki pages that you may want to bookmark is the @abstr_hyperlink page, which is an archive of notes about particularly disruptive commits or other changes that may affect you.

Another page of interest is a listing of all @abstr_hyperlink from the book that conveniently hyperlink to read-only version of the IPython Notebooks

## "Premium Support"

The source code in this repository is free for your use however you'd like. If you'd like to complete a more rigorous study about social web mining much like you would experience by following along with a textbook in a classroom, however, you should consider picking up a copy of @abstr_hyperlink and follow along. _Think of the book as offering a form of "premium support" for this open source project._ 

The publisher's description of the book follows for your convenience:

How can you tap into the wealth of social web data to discover who’s making connections with whom, what they’re talking about, and where they’re located? With this expanded and thoroughly revised edition, you’ll learn how to acquire, analyze, and summarize data from all corners of the social web including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, email, websites, and blogs. 

  * Employ IPython Notebook, the Natural Language Toolkit, NetworkX, and other scientific computing tools to mine popular social web sites
  * Apply advanced text-mining techniques, such as clustering and TF-IDF, to extract meaning from human language data
  * Bootstrap interest graphs from GitHub by discovering affinities among people, programming languages, and coding projects
  * Build interactive visualizations with D @abstr_number .js, a state-of-the-art HTML @abstr_number and JavaScript toolkit 
  * Take advantage of more than two-dozen Twitter recipes presented in O’Reilly’s popular and well-known cookbook format



The example code for this data science book is maintained in a public GitHub repository and is designed to be especially accessible through a turn-key virtual machine that facilitates interactive learning with an easy-to-use collection of IPython Notebooks.
