## Local Development

Here are some useful Gradle/adb commands for executing this example:

  * `./gradlew clean build` \- Build the entire example and execute unit and integration tests plus lint check.
  * `./gradlew installDebug` \- Install the debug apk on the current connected device.
  * `./gradlew runUnitTests` \- Execute domain and data layer tests (both unit and integration).
  * `./gradlew runAcceptanceTests` \- Execute espresso and instrumentation acceptance tests.
