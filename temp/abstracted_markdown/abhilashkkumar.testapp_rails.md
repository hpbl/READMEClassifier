# Test Rails App

( @abstr_hyperlink )

This Rails App has been fully configured with Nginx, Puma and Capistrano. This app isn't meant to be used as a starting point for your Application, this is just an example to take help from.

## App Details

This app uses:

  * __Ruby Version:__ `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`
  * __Rails Version:__ `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`
  * __Web Server:__ `Puma @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`
  * __Database:__ `MongoDB`
  * __Database Driver:__ `Mongoid @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`
  * __Automation Tool:__ `Capistrano @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`



## Test Droplet Details

The Droplet where this App was hosted had:

  * __Server IP:__ `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`
  * __SSH Port:__ `@abstr_number`
  * __User:__ `deploy`
  * __App Name (For Capistrano):__ `testapp`



In the DB Installation Step, I installed `MongoDB` since this app uses `Mongoid`.

## Testing on Your own Droplet

If you'd like to test this app on your own droplet, @abstr_hyperlink this repo and follow the DigitalOcean Guide step-by-step replacing parameters (such as Droplet IP, SSH Port, User, etc.) with your Repo URL and Droplet's information.
