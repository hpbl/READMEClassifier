A Java library that keeps OAuth @abstr_number . @abstr_number service access tokens in memory for your usage.

@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_image @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink 

## Maven dependency

@abstr_code_section 

### Apache-Httpclient is also needed because we depend on it currently

So, you also have to add it with:

@abstr_code_section 

## Usage

@abstr_code_section 

## Local testing

The "tokens" library allows injecting fixed OAuth @abstr_number access tokens via the `OAUTH @abstr_number _ACCESS_TOKENS` environment variable. This allows testing applications using the library locally with personal OAuth @abstr_number tokens (e.g. generated by "zign"):
