The easiest way to contribute is through pull requests on GitHub. Get a GitHub account if you don't have it already and clone the repository at @abstr_hyperlink with the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page. Check out your clone to your machine, code away, push your changes to your clone and submit a pull request; instructions are available at @abstr_hyperlink . (In case you need them, more detailed instructions for creating pull requests are at @abstr_hyperlink , and a basic guide to GitHub is at @abstr_hyperlink .

It's likely that we won't merge your code right away, and we'll ask for some changes instead. Don't be discouraged! That's normal; the library is complex, and thus it might take some time to become familiar with it and to use it in an idiomatic way.

We're looking forward to your contributions.
