# LightGBM, Light Gradient Boosting Machine

@abstr_hyperlink 

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:

  * Faster training speed and higher efficiency
  * Lower memory usage
  * Better accuracy
  * Parallel learning supported
  * Capable of handling large-scale data



For more details, please refer to @abstr_hyperlink .

@abstr_hyperlink on public datasets show that LightGBM can outperform other existing boosting framework on both efficiency and accuracy, with significant lower memory consumption. What's more, the @abstr_hyperlink show that LightGBM can achieve a linear speed-up by using multiple machines for training in specific settings.

## News

@abstr_number / @abstr_number / @abstr_number : **Categorical Features as input directly** (without one-hot coding). Experiment on @abstr_hyperlink shows about @abstr_number x speed-up with same accuracy compared with one-hot coding (refer to @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink ). For the setting details, please refer to IO Parameters.

@abstr_number / @abstr_number / @abstr_number : Release python-package beta version, welcome to have a try and provide issues and feedback.
