# Seccubus V @abstr_number Read Me

Seccubus automates regular vulnerability scans with vrious tools and aids security people in the fast analysis of its output, both on the first scan and on repeated scans.

On repeated scan delta reporting ensures that findings only need to be judged when they first appear in the scan results or when their output changes.

Seccubus @abstr_number .x is the only actively developed and maintained branch and all support for Seccubus V @abstr_number has officially been dropped. 

Seccubus V @abstr_number works with the following scanners: * Nessus @abstr_number .x and @abstr_number .x (professional and home feed) * Skipfish * OpenVAS * Medusa (local and remote) * Nikto (local and remote) * NMap (local and remote) * SSLyze * Medusa * Burp Suite * Qualys SSL labs
