# TimesSquare

TimesSquare is a library to display a calendar in a view in your iPhone or iPad app. We wrote it after searching high and low for a better way and finding none.

## Usage

@abstr_image 

Easy: create an instance of `TSQCalendarView`. Set its `firstDate` and `lastDate` properties to give yourself a range of dates.

## Calendars

@abstr_image 

While we fully expect you'll use it to display a Gregorian calendar most of the time, TimesSquare is just as happy displaying any of the calendars `NSCalendar` supports. The included test app shows you how to do this.

## Further documentation

If you install @abstr_hyperlink ("`brew install appledoc`") you can build the "TimesSquare Documentation" target in Xcode and see (and search!) the full API in your documentation window.
