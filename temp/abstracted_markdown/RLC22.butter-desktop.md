## Getting Started

If you're comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

If you clone the GitHub repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt.

The @abstr_hyperlink branch which contains the latest release.

#### Quickstart:

@abstr_number . `npm install -g grunt-cli bower` @abstr_number . `npm install` @abstr_number . `grunt build` @abstr_number . `grunt start`

If you encounter trouble with the above method, you can try:

@abstr_number . `npm install -g bower grunt-cli` (Linux: you may need to run with `sudo`) @abstr_number . `cd desktop` @abstr_number . `npm install` @abstr_number . `bower install` @abstr_number . `grunt lang` @abstr_number . `grunt nwjs` @abstr_number . `grunt css` @abstr_number . `grunt start`

Optionally, you may simply run `./make_butter.sh` if you are on a linux or mac based operating system.

Full instructions & troubleshooting tips can be found in the Contributing Guide

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Butter will be maintained according to the @abstr_hyperlink guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`

Constructed with the following guidelines:

  * A new _major_ release indicates a large change where backward compatibility is broken.
  * A new _minor_ release indicates a normal change that maintains backward compatibility.
  * A new _patch_ release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
  * A new _build_ release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
