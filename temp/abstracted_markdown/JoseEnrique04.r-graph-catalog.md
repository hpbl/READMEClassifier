# R Graph Catalog

The r-graph-catalog subdirectory of this repo creates the @abstr_hyperlink Shiny app.

This catalog is a complement to @abstr_hyperlink by @abstr_hyperlink . All graphs were produced using the @abstr_hyperlink and the add-on package @abstr_hyperlink , written by @abstr_hyperlink . The gallery is maintained by Joanna Zhao and @abstr_hyperlink .

The initial work on this project was facilitated by an @abstr_hyperlink .

#### Inspiration

We are inspired by the @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink . Our goal is to create a simple and organized visual index of diverse ggplot @abstr_number graphs. Naomi Robbins' book provided a great set of figures to start with.

We are very interested in extending this catalog, possibly helping to revive to the dormant @abstr_hyperlink .

#### Contributing a figure

_Ideally, this would be easier, but let's just see if anyone wants to contribute a figure before we worry about this too much!_

@abstr_number . Fork this repository and pull to your local machine. @abstr_number . Run `make init` to create your own figure directory under `figures` @abstr_number . In the newly generated figure directory, read `instuctions.md` and make the appropriate changes. @abstr_number . Make a single commit (include `*.R`, `*_tags.txt`, `README-fodder.md`, and data file (if any)) @abstr_number . Push back to your fork on GitHub. @abstr_number . Make a pull request.
