# Cecil

Mono.Cecil is a library to generate and inspect programs and libraries in the ECMA CIL form.

To put it simply, you can use Cecil to:

  * Analyze .NET binaries using a simple and powerful object model, without having to load assemblies to use Reflection.
  * Modify .NET binaries, add new metadata structures and alter the IL code.



Cecil has been around since @abstr_number and is @abstr_hyperlink in the .NET community.

The best way to learn how to use Cecil is to dive into the @abstr_hyperlink repository. It's a growing collection of samples with the goal of showing how to get things done using Cecil, as IL manipulation can sometime get tricky.

Read about the Cecil development on the @abstr_hyperlink .

To discuss Cecil, the best place is the @abstr_hyperlink Google Group.

Cecil is a project under the benevolent umbrella of the @abstr_hyperlink .
