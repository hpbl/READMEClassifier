@abstr_hyperlink 

AngularStrap is a set of native directives that enables seamless integration of @abstr_hyperlink into your @abstr_hyperlink app.

  * With no external dependency except the @abstr_hyperlink , AngularStrap is lighter and faster than ever as it does leverage the power of ngAnimate from AngularJS @abstr_number . @abstr_number +!

  * AngularStrap is @abstr_hyperlink against the latest patch release of the @abstr_number . @abstr_number , @abstr_number . @abstr_number and @abstr_number . @abstr_number branches.

  * If you don't want to use `ngAnimate`, you will have to include a tiny @abstr_hyperlink .
